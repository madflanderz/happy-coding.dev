Sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.

### The Setup

Before you can sync, you need to add a remote that points to the upstream repository. You may have done this when you originally forked.

> Tip: Syncing your fork only updates your local copy of the repository; it does not update your repository on GitHub.

```shell
# List the current remotes
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

# Set a new remote
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/otheruser/repo.git

# Verify new remote
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/otheruser/repo.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/otheruser/repo.git (push)
```

### Syncing

There are two steps required to sync your repository with the upstream: first you must fetch from the remote, then you must rebase or merge the desired branch into your local branch.

#### Fetching

Fetching from the remote repository will bring in its branches and their respective commits. These are stored in your local repository under special branches.

```shell
# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
# such as upstream/master:
$ git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:
git checkout master
```

We now have the upstream's master branch stored in a local branch, upstream/master

```shell
# List all local and remote-tracking branches
$ git branch -va
* master                  a422352 My local commit
  remotes/origin/HEAD     -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master   a422352 My local commit
  remotes/upstream/master 5fdff0f Some upstream commit
```

#### Rebase

Last step is to rebase your branch and push the changes to your branch.

```shell
# rebase
git rebase upstream/master

# push changes to github
git push -f origin master
```

> You only need to use the -f the first time after you've rebased.
