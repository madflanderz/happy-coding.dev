This post is about the easiest way to restart a rails server.

### What happend

Today i encountered some errors on my side project [Graffiti-Unlimited.com]. Some users saw an error page directly after login. I found the reason for this problem very fast **But** i a had a big problem - i was at work and couldn't fix and deploy like i regulary do.

#### Restart server with restart.txt

One eays way to restart a running passenger rails server is by touching the file `restart.txt` in the application directory's `tmp` subdirectory. Passenger needs maybe some seconds to recognize the change and will restart the application.
